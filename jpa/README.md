# JPA Issues

This repository contains two source code packages.
One is the OSIV, [Transaction and NamedEnitity Playground](jpa-issues.md) where all the tasks of our
training are included (osiv project).

The other one is a possible solution with a configured named entity graph as well as another example
for the influence of setting auto-commit to false (osiv-solution).
